// Questions
// =========
// 1. Find out where the peaks of amount of edits are (per article if idâ€™s are comparable) per community.
// 2. Which language has the most active unique users during which time (where an active user is a user that has during a timespan X at least Y number of posts).
// 3. Measure the similarity of pages (expressed in the number of edits for this article over a certain time span and the number of unique users that were involved in these edits)
// 4. Cascading of edits over time
// 5. Evolution of editing behaviour (will need data for a long time span)
